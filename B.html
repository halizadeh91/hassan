            <h2>Six Dead in Hudson River Helicopter Crash Near New York City​</h2>
            
            <p>On April 10, 2025, a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River near Jersey City, New Jersey, killing all six people aboard. The victims included a Spanish family of five and the pilot.​</p>
            
            <p>The Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, departed from Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m. Approximately 18 minutes into the flight, the helicopter experienced a mid-air structural failure, causing it to plunge into the river near the Newport neighborhood of Jersey City. The aircraft lacked flight data and cockpit voice recorders, complicating the investigation. ​</p>
            
            <p>The passengers were identified as Siemens Spain CEO Agustín Escobar, his wife Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children, aged 4, 8, and 10. They were in New York celebrating Mercè's birthday. The pilot, 36-year-old Sean Johnson, was a former U.S. Navy SEAL pursuing a career in aviation. </p>
            
            <p>Eyewitnesses described the helicopter breaking apart mid-air before crashing. Emergency responders recovered four victims at the scene; two others died later at Jersey City Medical Center. </p>
            
            <p>The incident prompted immediate reactions. New York City Mayor Eric Adams expressed condolences, stating, "Our hearts go out to the families of those who were onboard." Senator Chuck Schumer called for the revocation of the operator's license, citing safety concerns. </p>
            
            <p>In response, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suspended New York Helicopter Tours' operating certificate and initiated a review of the company's safety practices. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading the investigation into the crash. ​</p>
            
            <p>The tragedy has reignited debates over the safety of aerial tours in densely populated areas, with officials and the public calling for stricter regulations to prevent future incidents.​</p>
