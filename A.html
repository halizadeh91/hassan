        <div><h2>CBS Anchor Gets Emotional as She Reports 6 People Died in Helicopter Crash Over New York City</h2>

            <p>"This is not the news you ever want to hear," she said, going on to add, "This is not just another day in the office"</p>
            
            <p>A CBS anchor grew emotional as she reacted on live TV to a deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River just outside New York City on Thursday, April 10.</p>
            
            <p>All six people on board the craft, including the pilot, reportedly died — though authorities have not yet shared key details such as what caused the crash, which took place around 3:15 p.m. local time, or who the victims were.</p>
            
            <p>"This never ever escapes me when you have to cover these types of stories on what you believe to be, will be, a normal day and it turns out to be anything but," CBS New York anchor Kristine Johnson said during the network's live coverage of the crash.</p>
            
            <p>A law enforcement source told PEOPLE that a family of five from Spain was on the helicopter.</p>

            <p>As Johnson reported on CBS that everyone aboard the helicopter had died, her voice shook and grew thick with emotion.</p>
            
            <p>"This is not the news you ever want to hear," she said, going on to add, "This is not just another day in the office."</p>
            
            <p>The New York City Fire Department previously told PEOPLE the crash occurred on the New Jersey side of the water but that the FDNY was assisting. The Hoboken Fire Department said the crash took place in Jersey City.</p>
            
            <p>The Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating alongside the National Transportation Safety Board, said the aircraft, which remained submerged in the water, was a Bell 206 helicopter.</p>
